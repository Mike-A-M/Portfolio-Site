            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>I am currently employed as a Cloud Services Specialist for a global physical security company. I am a fully qualified remote security support specialist. I am certified in several access control, network video surveillance and intrusion prevention systems.
                I have a Master of Science in Information Technology from the University of Cincinnati and a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from Governors State University. I have extensive art and design studio education from the Herron School of Art at Indiana University, The Art Academy University of San Francisco, and the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. 
                I am currently finishing both Front End and Back End Engineering Program at Code Academy and studying for AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification. I will be receiving a Graphic Arts Certification from California Arts and Design Academy within the next few months. </p>
                
            <p>I have a keen interest for web design and graphics, cloud applications, and IoT fabrications. </p>

             <p>I have a solid background in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop and working knowledge of After Effects. I supplement my professional time creating and integrating home automation appliances. 
                I still study formal studio art pursuits. My primary media are pastels and do some sculpture in Limestone and Alabaster as well.</p>
                
                My home automation fabrications push me to study non-structural welding, simple metal working and CAD applications for printing. </p>
            <h3>
                Personal Details</h3>
            <p>I am 52 years old and was raised near Chicago Illinois and reside in Indianapolis, Indiana. I have one adult autistic son.  I am Roman Catholic and support both NAMI and Autism Speaks Charities. </p>
