            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>I am currently employed as a Cloud Services Specialist for a global physical security company. I am a fully qualified remote security support specialist certified across several access control, network video surveillance and intrusion prevention systems.
                I have a Master of Science Degree in Information Technology from the University of Cincinnati and a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from Governors State University. I have extensive art and design studio education from the Herron School of Art at Indiana University, 
                The Art Academy University of San Francisco, and the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. 
                I completed the Front-End Engineering Curriculum from Treehouse and am currently finishing the Full-Stack program as well; I am seeking Photoshop Visual Designer Certification from Adobe.
            </p>
            <p>I have keen interest for cloud applications, web design, and graphic design.
               I have personal curiosity for the Internet of Things integration into web applications (home automation).
            </p>    
             <p>I possess intermediate skill levels in Java Script, Python, CSS, and C++.
                I purse freelance work in graphic design and web design opportunities. I continue to study Classical Drawing. My favorite media, however, are pastels and  I do some sculpture in Limestone and Alabaster as well.
                From the IT perspective, it is my goal to complete an AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification by mid 2026.
